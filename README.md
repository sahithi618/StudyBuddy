Hello,
I'm Sirimalla Sahithi, a 3rd year undergarduate in Chemical Engineering at Indian Institutte of Techmology Ropar.

## Problem Statement
Students in universities often face information overload, with lecture notes, PDFs, and textbooks piling up in formats that don’t match their personal way of learning. A single method of studying cannot suit everyone — some prefer quizzes, others need summaries or flashcards. This lack of adaptability makes it harder for students to retain knowledge effectively. To address this, we propose an AI-powered study assistant that converts raw study material into flexible learning aids — summaries, quizzes, or flashcards — enabling each student to study in the way that works best for them and easing the pressure of academic life.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
